/* this file uses selectors to pick elements to do stuff to them. the priority of which elements are picked is the following:

1 type + id
  - type <a> with id #name e.g. a#id
2 id
  - eg. #id
3 type + class
  - eg. h2.border
4 class
  - eg. .border
5 flere typer
  - eg. "div h1" ændrer alle h1'er i div, mens "div, h1" ændrer alle div'er og h1'er
6 typer
  - eg. "h1, h2" ændrer alle h1'er og h2'er
7 universal
